# The Oasis system is a platform for Windows, where its main function is to provide 
technical support to Libraries and Librarians. At DSLabs we produce we are producing 
an open source system where each institution can modify it for whatever it wishes. 
# We think of a system in java, php and SQL to organize storing and controlling the 
flow of book rentals. and the control of library users. But the reader will also have 
access to a table where they will have a list of books where they can use and know which 
books they will rent for example.
